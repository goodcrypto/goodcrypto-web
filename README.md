#goodcrypto_web - GoodCrypto Web

GoodCrypto Web provides Tor, plus privacy and malware filtering, for groups.


##Introduction

GoodCrypto Web guards your identity while you browse. You are also protected against malicious software, "malware", delivered through your browser.

GoodCrypto Web does not protect you from exposing your own identity. If you provide private information to anyone online, your information is not safe. With GoodCrypto you are protected against malware while browsing. But if you download any files, they may contain malware or expose your private information.

Executables, video, audio, and images can carry tracking bugs and malware, so safe browsing does not include them. The web looks much calmer. Some sites complain when they can't track you. They claim your system is misconfigured. Ignore them.


##Repository

This repository acts as a backup for the source code. We strongly encourage users to <a href="https://goodcrypto.com/server/download/">download the ISO</a> which includes full source code and is preconfigured.
